# AI Appendix - chris koutras

For the team charter assignment, three separate tools marketed as AI were used. I used the tools to produce a document template, inspire specific sections, and to generate images. I was familiar with some of these tools prior to the assignment but do not used them regularly or professionally.

1. Chat-GPT 3.5 August-3-Version <https://chat.openai.com/>
1. DALL-E-2 <https://openai.com/dall-e-2>
1. Fotor <https://www.fotor.com/photo-editor-app/editor/effect>

## Chat-GPT

### How it was used

Chat-GPT was prompted with the Team Charter Prompt directly from the assignment source. I prefaced the document as follows

```text
Given the following prompt, produce a team charter document...[verbiage from 'Group Project Assignment.pdf']
```

The output was well structured markdown and included several creative inputs. In our first team meeting, we used this output as the foundation for our document and had a discussion around it. Sections from the document were assigned sections group members. In the end, we deviated from the template structure and at times injected language from other prompts.

As an example, each member was asked to write their own bio section. I prompted Chat-GPT with the following.

```text
You are planning a heist and you need a crack programmer who solves problems with clean code. Write a 3 sentence about why Chris is a great lead developer.
```

```text
Instead of planning a heist, you are providing consulting for a private equity fund. Describe why chris is the perfect lead programmer.
```

```text
Rewrite this as if it an introduction on CNBC
```

The responses, provided several keywords and attributes which I chose to keep in my initial draft.

### Effectiveness

Highly Effective. 8 out of 10.

This provided exactly what I was looking for. I didn't expect to use the output exactly but I found it valuable.

### Tutorial/Recommendation

This tool can be valuable in two capacities. Firstly, it was very quick at generating a serviceable outline for a business document. It can probably replace a lot of standard company templates or base-documents. I believe it accepts key information on sections and fills them with more meaningful content than a lorem ipsum generator would do. Second, it is a surprisingly good tool for improvisation and creative or themed output. It provided voice consistent with my expectations.

## Dall-E 2

### How it was used

Dall-E is an image generation tool that was used to create a logo for our team. I had an image in my mind of dog acting as sherlock holmes. I've see images in a similar theme to this before in my life, but I have essentially no ability to create that image given traditional tools. There were several iterations before an image I found acceptable was reached.

```

### Effectiveness

Fair. 5 out of 10.

This tool provided a capability to create original art. The prompting exercise yielded was much less intuitive than the text generation tools.

### Tutorial

There were two ways I attempted to use this tool. Firstly, by uploading an image and using the prompt to edit. I expected to be able to apply an effect to my profile photo but this yielded results that very different than the original and would not work as a head-shot.

I would recommend only using this tool for fully text prompting. The 'variation' user flow also created moderately positive results. Including language such as 'in the style of' seemed to narrow the amount of variation substantially.

## Fotor

### How it was used / Tutorial

This is a photo effect/filter tool available online. I uploaded my profile photo and selected a filter. I didn't feel that I needed to understand the theme's or transformations included in the filter. After a couple selected effects, I found one that was acceptable.

### Effectiveness

Fair. 6 out of 10.

The output from this tool was much less abstract compared to Dall-E. Outside of the filters, the other editing and effects were not useful.
